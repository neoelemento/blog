I love listening to podcasts. I feel they are great learning resources. Especially when you can fill up your otherwise wasted time like commuting to work etc listening to them. I have subscribed to a few of them which I have listed here:

## [Shop Talk Show](http://shoptalkshow.com) 

<img style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%;" src="http://shoptalkshow.com/wp-content/themes/shoptalk2/images/shoptalk_logo.png" class="center-align">

[Shop Talk Show](http://shoptalkshow.com), co-hosted by [Chris Coyier](http://chriscoyier.net) of [CSS Tricks](http://css-tricks.com) and [Dave Rupert](http://daverupert.com) of [Paravel](http://paravelinc.com) is one of my favourites. The fun attitude of the hosts and tonne of information that it provides are both mind blowing. Typical episode is an interview with someone important from the web world. In between there are few episodes called "rapidfire" where the duo answer listener questions. It's an award winning fun podcast and listening to it, you'll know why.

## [This Developer's Life](http://thisdeveloperslife.com/)

<img style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%;" src="http://thisdeveloperslife.com/images/tdl_logo1.png" class="center-align">

A podcast about developers and their lives. This one is hosted by Scott Henselman and  Rob Conery, is like a behind the scenes look at what goes in a developer's life.

## [Five Minute Geek Show](http://fiveminutegeekshow.com)

<img style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%;" src="https://media.simplecast.com/podcast/logo_image/335/twitter-etc-fmgs-logo-white.png" class="center-align">

This is a podcast by [Matt Stauffer](http://mattstauffer.co) with episodes lasting for around 5-10 mins each. Mostly geeky topics related to development, design, project management and other topics, this is a podcast which does not take too much of your time but conveys a good deal of information. I love this one for the cheerful approach Matt gives it.

## [Developer Tea](http://developertea.com)

This podcast is all about developers and related stuff by Jonathan Cutrell. This alternates between interviews and motivational episodes. A very awesome podcast!

## [Late nights with Trav and Los](http://www.travandlos.com/)

<img style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%;" src="https://media.simplecast.com/podcast/logo_image/311/Trav_and_Los_avatar_Final.png" class="center-align">

This is another of my favourites by Travis Neilson and Carlos Montoya who are designers. In their own words this  podcast is a late night discussion about being a healthy and productive professional in todays creative economy. Casual, fun, educational (maybe)! I love the ideas they toss around.

## [Codepen Radio](https://blog.codepen.io/radio/)

<img style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; background-color: black;" src="http://media.creativebloq.futurecdn.net/sites/creativebloq.com/files/images/2015/01/codepenradio.jpg" class="center-align">

Codepen Radio is a podcast about building and running an app and the behind the scenes. Hosted by the crew behind [CodePen](http://codepen.io), they discuss about how they built Codepen, how they manage finances and legal stuff and how they hire resources. Very good insight into building a product and running a business.

Tangible insights on creativity and business every single Wednesday and Friday. This podcast by Sean McCabe and Ben Toalson as they let you inside their discussions on the many facets of making a living online. Rich with life tips and business insights, this one is high on my favorites lists.
